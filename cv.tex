\section{PhD Thesis}
\cvitem{Title}{\emph{Hybrid-Neural Synthesis of Machine-Checkable Software Correctness Proofs}}
\cvitem{Supervisor}{Professor Sorin Lerner}

\cvitem{Description}{The correctness of large software artifacts has
  important impact on many aspects of the modern
  world. Machine-checkable software correctness proofs provide a
  guarantee that a piece of software adheres to some logical
  specification, however producing such proofs is labor-intensive,
  taking in some cases 23 person-years of highly skilled labor to
  prove properties of 10,000 line programs. This thesis work uses a
  hybrid-approach of machine learning and proof assistant search
  procedures to produce proofs of correctness for a large variety of
  software automatically or semi-automatically.}

\section{Masters Thesis}
\cvitem{Title}{\emph{Dynamic Analysis of Floating Point Errors with Herbgrind}}
\cvitem{Supervisor}{Professor Zachary Tatlock}
\cvitem{Description}{Numerical computation using floating point
  numbers is notoriously difficult to reason about, even in idealized
  environments. This thesis presents the development of a tool which
  can analyze the runtime behavior of programs written in a variety of
  environments and languages, and extract inaccurate floating point
  computation for improvement.}

\section{Bachelors Thesis}

\cvitem{Title}{\emph{Algebraic Simplification for the Herbie Project}}
\cvitem{Supervisor}{Professor Zachary Tatlock}
\cvitem{Description}{The ability to simplify arbitrary mathematical
  expressions is extremely useful in many applications, including the
  Herbie numerical synthesis tool, but is exponential in general. This
  thesis presents a set of data structures and heuristics that allow
  thousands of expressions to be simplified every second.}
