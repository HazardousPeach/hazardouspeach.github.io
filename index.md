Alex Sanchez-Stern
==================

Hey I'm Alex Sanchez-Stern, I'm a third year undergraduate at the
University of Washington, working on a project called
[Herbie](http://herbie.uwplse.org).

Herbie
------

[Herbie](http://herbie.uwplse.org) is a tool to help scientists and
programmers write accurate floating point code more easily. You give
it a floating point expression, and it tests it against hundreds of
points to find a version that's more accurate.

You can reach me at
[asnchstr@cs.washington.edu](mailto:asnchstr@cs.washington.edu), my
university email address, or find me in the Allen G. Center for
Computer Science & Engineering, CSE 407 most weekdays during the
quarter.
