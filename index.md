Alex Sanchez-Stern
==================

Hey I'm Alex Sanchez-Stern, I'm a PhD student at the University of
California San Diego. I'm also part of the team at the UW that built
[Herbie](http://herbie.uwplse.org). I graduated from the UW with a
Masters degree in the Spring of 2016. I'm generally interested in
using synthesis to elide complex domain details, and improving the
usability of proof assistants through better proof search and new
meta-language frameworks.

Herbie
------

[Herbie](http://herbie.uwplse.org) is a tool to help scientists and
programmers write accurate floating point code more easily. You give
it a floating point expression, and it tests it against hundreds of
points to find a version that's more accurate. Herbie is open source
software, published at PLDI 2015.

Herbgrind
---------

[Herbgrind](http://herbgrind.ucsd.edu) is a debugging tool to help
developers find the *root cause* of floating-point inaccuracy in large
numerical software. It runs directly on program binaries, and produces
reports about inaccuracies found that affect program
outputs. Herbgrind is free and open source software, published at PLDI
2018.

So far I've co-authored a few papers:

[Automatically Improving Accuracy for Floating Point Expressions](http://herbie.uwplse.org/pldi15-paper.pdf)

[Toward a Standard Benchmark Format and Suite for Floating-Point Analysis](http://fpbench.org/nsv16-paper.pdf)

[Finding Root Causes of Floating Point Error](http://herbgrind.ucsd.edu/herbgrind-pldi18.pdf)
