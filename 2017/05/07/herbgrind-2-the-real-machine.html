  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Welcome back to my series of posts on Herbgrind, a dynamic analysis
tool that finds floating point issues in compiled programs. The
purpose of this series is to explain how Herbgrind works and the
principles behind its design. To do that, we’re starting with a
simple hypothetical computer called the “Float Machine”, which is just
enough to capture the interesting floating point behavior of a real
computer, like the one that’s probably sitting on your desk.</p>

<p><img src="//images/full-logo.png" alt="Herbgrind logo" style="width:30%" class="centered" /></p>

<p>In
the
<a href="//2017/04/27/herbgrind-1-the-float-machine.html">last post</a>,
we defined the Float Machine. This meant talking about how it
executes, and what its programs look like. In this post, I’ll describe
how Herbgrind determines how much error is in a Float Machine
program.</p>

<h2 id="analyzing-programs-for-the-float-machine">Analyzing Programs for the Float Machine</h2>

<p>In the last post, we introduced the float machine, a simple machine
which can run floating point programs in its own language. This
language has three instructions: an “operation” instruction which
takes some values from memory, runs a floating-point function on them,
and puts them back in memory; a “branch” instruction which jumps to a
different part of the program if some condition holds; and an “output”
instruction which prints a value to the screen.</p>

<p><img src="//images/floatmachine-w-program.png" alt="A Float Machine" class="centered" /></p>

<p>We can think of Herbgrind as just another machine that runs these
programs, but runs them slightly differently. The Herbgrind machine
includes the Float Machine as part of it, so that it can report
information about the actual execution. But it also has some more
sub-machines, which execute the program in other ways, and sometimes
talk to each other.</p>

<p><img src="//images/herbgrind-mystery-machines.jpg" alt="The Herbgrind Mystery Machine" class="centered" style="width:75%" /></p>

<p>The machine we’ll talk about in this post is called the Real machine,
because it executes the program in the real numbers. But first, we’ll
talk about why we need this machine. In Herbgrind, each machine solves
a problem. And the first problem that people face when trying to find
the cause of floating point error, is that floating point error is
generally silent.</p>

<h2 id="a-primer-on-silent-error">A Primer on Silent Error</h2>

<p>Floating point error, unlike other types of bugs in a
program, doesn’t generally have a place where it “happens”. Instead
it’s something that slowly grows through multiple instructions, so
that at any given point it’s not clear how “wrong” the computed answer
is.</p>

<p>This may seem counter-intuitive. After all, an answer is either wrong
or it isn’t, right? To get a sense of how error can appear without any
particular step seeming bad, let’s look at a simple example.</p>

<p>Let’s say you’re computing the formula:</p>

\[(x + 1) - x\]

<p>This formula looks reasonable (although a bit redundant) at first. A
few simple mathematical transformation can show us that the value of
this formula is 1 for any value of \(x\).</p>

\[(x + 1) - x \\
(1 + x) - x \\
1 + (x - x) \\
1 + 0 \\
1\]

<p>However, when the original formula is run in floating point, and given
a large value of \(x\), it’ll return 0 instead of 1! For \(x =
10^{16}\), \((x + 1)\) isn’t representable in floating point, so the 1
gets rounded off. This means the entire computation goes like this:</p>

\[(10^{16} + 1) - 10^{16} \\
10^{16} - 10^{16} \\
0\]

<p>You can see that the error appears in the second line, when the 1
gets rounded off, resulting in the wrong answer in the end.</p>

<p>However, looking at each piece of the computation in isolation, it’s
not clear that anything particularly bad is happening. Just looking at
the addition which actually causes the error, you would see:</p>

\[10^{16} + 1 \\
10^{16}\]

<p>The correct answer is \(10^{16}+1\), but the computation gets
\(10^{16}\). But, \(10^{16}\) is actually the closest floating point
number to \(10^{16}\), so it’s not actually possible to do this
addition any better. And, even if it were possible to do better,
relative to \(10^{15}\), this difference is pretty small. Depending on
what you do with it afterwards, this amount of error might not
matter. For instance, if you were to divide the result by \(10^{16}\),
then you would get 10 vs. 10.0000000000000001, which is a negligible
amount of error (and once again, not representable any better in
64-bit floating point).</p>

<p>The next step isn’t any more clearly wrong either. After all, 0 <em>is</em>
the right answer when subtracting \(10^{16}\) and \(10^{16}\). Because
we’ve lost the information on how the orignal answer was slightly
wrong, you can’t see at this step that there is now major error.</p>

<p>Calculations like this are why floating point error is generally
silent. You wouldn’t want the computer to crash every time it had to
round the answer a small amount. But these tiny errors can grow later,
and their growth is virtually undetectable</p>

<h2 id="making-the-error-loud">Making The Error Loud</h2>

<p>To fix this, we need to create some way to check the answer at every
step, and see how far it is getting from the “correct” answer. Since
we use floating point to approximate the real numbers, we want to say
an answer is “correct” when it’s just like the real number
answer. Unfortunately this idea of correctness is a little too
strong. Since there are an infinite number of real numbers, and only a
finite number of floating point numbers, not every real number can be
perfectly represented in the floats. So instead of saying an answer is
correct when it’s exactly the real number answer, we’ll say it’s
correct if it is the <em>closest</em> floating point number to the real
answer.</p>

<p>Put another way, we can say that a floating point program is perfectly
correct if the following equation holds:</p>

\[\forall x, \\
\texttt{prog}_{\mathbb{F}}(x) = [[ \texttt{prog}_{\mathbb{R}}([[x]]_{\mathbb{R}}) ]]_{\mathbb{F}}\]

<p>This says that for every floating point input \(x\), if we convert
that number to a real number (\([[x]]_{\mathbb{R}}\)), and then run
the program on it as a real number program
(\(\texttt{prog}_{\mathbb{R}}\)), and finally round it back to a float
(\([[\_]]_{\mathbb{F}}\)), we get the same answer as when we compute
it normally using floats (\(\texttt{prog}_{\mathbb{F}}\)). This is the
best accuracy we could possibly get from a floating point program.</p>

<p>This definition might not seem like it’s giving us anything extra, but
we’ll see that by applying it to the whole program, instead of just
each operation, we can catch the error which would otherwise be
silent. To apply this definition to the whole program, though, we’ll
need to have someway to compute what the program <em>should</em> have been,
in the real numbers. This is the first task of the Real Machine.</p>

<p>The Real Machine is a lot like the Float Machine from
the
<a href="//2017/04/27/herbgrind-1-the-float-machine.html">last post</a>,
except it does everything in the Reals. It uses the same program as
the float machine, but it has a “Real” processor which can do real
number calculations, and “Real” memory for storing these real numbers.</p>

<p><img src="//images/real-machine-unattached.png" alt="A Real Machine" class="centered" /></p>

<p>Since the Real Machine only checks the accuracy of the float machine,
it doesn’t need its own output. And since it only cares about
floating point calculations, it doesn’t need its own <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int</code> memory
(memory that holds non-float values). But to keep track of where it is
in the program, and check the error of the float machine, it depends
on being connected to the float machine.</p>

<p><img src="//images/herbgrind-float-and-real.jpg" alt="Herbgrind with Float and Real Machines" class="centered" /></p>

<p>With the Real machine, we can finally identify whole program
error. But we still need a way to determine whether the error is large
or small. For this, we have to quantify the error that appears.</p>

<h2 id="quantifying-error">Quantifying Error</h2>

<p>Since programs often don’t compute the “correct” answer, it’s
useful to know how far the result is from the right answer. If it’s
not exactly right, but very close, then in a lot of situations we
don’t care. However, even for simple programs, sometimes the answer
computed is very far from the right answer. We’re going to call the
distance between the computed answer and the right answer the
“floating point error” of the program.</p>

\[\texttt{error}(\texttt{prog}, x) =
\varepsilon(\texttt{prog}_{\mathbb{F}}(x), [[
\texttt{prog}_{\mathbb{R}}([[x]]_{\mathbb{R}}) ]]_{\mathbb{F}})\]

<p>This definition leaves two things open. One is that we haven’t defined
what it means to be the distance between two floating point numbers,
in this equation represented by the function \(\varepsilon\). And this
definition is for how much error a program has <em>on a particular
input</em>; what about the program as a whole? For both of these questions,
there isn’t one right answer. But we can pick some that tend to be
pretty useful in practice.</p>

<h4 id="the-error-between-two-numbers">The Error Between Two Numbers</h4>

<p>First, let’s think about how to measure the distance between two
floating point numbers. When we’re measuring the distance between two
real numbers, it’s common to use either absolute error, or relative
error. Absolute error is just the actual difference between the numbers:</p>

\[\varepsilon_{\texttt{absolute}}(x, y) = |x - y|\]

<p>While relative error is the difference as a fraction of the right answer:</p>

\[\varepsilon_{\texttt{relative}}(x, y) = |\frac{x - y}{x}|\]

<p>Absolute error is nice because it’s a relatively simple, intuitive
notion. However, its problem is that it doesn’t capture the notion
that error means different things on different scales. If a program is
supposed to return 1,000,000, and it instead returns 1,000,001, we
don’t usually think of that as very much error. But if it is supposed
to return 0, and it returns 1, that’s pretty bad. With absolute error,
both of these differences are treated the same.</p>

<p>Relative error helps fix this problem by scaling the error according
to the right answer. However, it has its own problems. Since it
divides by the correct answer, what do you do when the correct answer
is zero? And how do you account for the fact that floating point
numbers aren’t spaced exactly exponentially, so numbers of different
sizes will tend to have more or less relative error?</p>

<p>To address both these issues, Herbgrind borrows a tool
from <a href="https://github.com/StanfordPL/stoke">StokeFP</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/uwplse/herbie">Herbie</a>. Both of these program
transformation tools measure error in something called Units in the
Last Place, or ULPs. Essentially, this measures how many floating
point values there are between the correct answer, and the answer that
you got. For instance, if those two numbers are right next to each
other (there are no floating point values in between), but not the
same, the error is 1 ULP. If the answers are as far as they can
possibly be from each other, the error is \(2^{64} - 1\) ULPs.</p>

<p>You might notice that there’s a 64 in that number, just like the
number of bits used in your computer to represent (double-precision)
floats. This isn’t just a coincidence: if you take the \(\log_2\) of
the number of ulps, you get something like the number of bits
different between two floating point numbers. So we can say that two
values on the opposite ends of the number line have “64 bits” of
error, and two values that are right next to each other have “1 bit”
of error.</p>

<h4 id="aggregating-whole-program-error">Aggregating Whole Program Error</h4>

<p>Now that we know how to measure the error on a particular input using
our \(\varepsilon\) function, we want to know how to give an error
score to the whole program, not just on a particular input.</p>

<p>To do this, we’re going to measure two things: the error in the worst
case, called “max error”, and the error in general, called “average
error”. In some applications, it’s super important that the answer
never be very wrong. For those, it’s useful to pay attention to the
max error. In other applications, you just want to have most of your
answers be correct. We found while working on Herbie that floating
point error tends to be either really big or really small, so average
error generally measures how many inputs are really bad.</p>

<hr />

<p>Phew, that’s a lot of information. Okay, now we know:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What floating point error is</li>
  <li>How to measure it for a particular input</li>
  <li>How to grade a program on its floating point error</li>
</ul>

<p>With just this Real Machine, Herbgrind can detect error in floating
point programs, and tell you how bad it is. But Herbgrind’s mission
isn’t over. Knowing how bad your floating point error is isn’t enough
to help you fix it: you have to know where it comes from. The next
posts will define some more machines that Herbgrind uses to find the
cause of floating point error in a program.</p>
