  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Welcome back to my series of posts on Herbgrind, a dynamic analysis
tool that finds floating point issues in compiled programs. The
purpose of this series is to explain how Herbgrind works and the
principles behind its design. To do that, we started with a simple
hypothetical computer called the “Float Machine”, which is just enough
to capture the interesting floating point behavior of a real computer,
like the one that’s probably sitting on your desk. Now, we’re bringing
Herbgrind’s analysis to the real world, making it computable and fast.</p>

<p><img src="//images/full-logo.png" alt="Herbgrind logo" style="width:30%" class="centered" /></p>

<p>In the last four posts in the series, we built up Herbgrind for
the
<a href="//2017/04/27/herbgrind-1-the-float-machine.html">Float Machine</a>,
a hypothetical machine which executes floating point programs. We
showed that Herbgrind is actually composed of three machines run on
top of the float machine, sharing the program.</p>

<p>The first,
the
<a href="//2017/05/07/herbgrind-2-the-real-machine.html">Real Machine</a>,
computes the program with perfect accuracy, exactly as we would in the
pure mathematical real numbers. Then, it compares the final result
computed this way to the final result computed by the float machine,
using floating point numbers. By measuring the difference between the
two outputs, the Real Machine can compute the “floating point error”
of the program.</p>

<p>The second machine,
the
<a href="//2017/05/10/herbgrind-3-the-local-machine.html">Local Machine</a>,
computes each operation in a “locally approximate” way. This means
taking exact inputs, and rounding them to floats, and then executing
the float operation using them. With this method, the Local Machine
can detect at which operations error first appears, so it can start to
zero in on the cause of the error. The Local Machine also tracks what
outputs these sources of error influence, so that the user doesn’t
have to worry about error that doesn’t affect the results they care
about.</p>

<p>Finally,
the
<a href="//2017/05/20/herbgrind-4-the-symbolic-machien.html">Symbolic Machine</a> tracks
how each value in the program was built. This way, when the Local
Machine detects error in an operation, they Symbolic Machine can tell
the user what operations preceded the error, and thus help the user
diagnose and fix the error.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve defined what Herbgrind does in the abstract, it’s time
to bring the power of Herbgrind to your desk. To do that, we’re going
to enlist the help of one of the most incredible (and at times,
infuriating) pieces of software I’ve ever encountered: Valgrind.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-valgrind">What is Valgrind?</h2>

<p><a href="http://valgrind.org"><img src="http://valgrind.org/images/valgrind-link3.png" alt="Valgrind Logo" style="width:auto; display:block; margin: 0 auto" /></a></p>

<p>A few of you might have encountered Valgrind while debugging C code in
a programming class. Its most popular “tool”, Memcheck, is endlessly
useful for its ability to diagnose memory errors in programs in unsafe
languages like C. But, as I was mostly unaware before starting this
project, Valgrind is actually a powerful framework for creating
analysis tools.</p>

<p>Valgrind provides an interface for building programs, called “tools”,
which analyze a program by running it in a modified environment, and
observing parts of its state. Valgrind tools can have their own state,
and do pretty much anything they want to the analyzed
program. Valgrind operates on program binaries directly, and works
across a variety of architectures, making it both portable across
systems and relatively language independent.</p>

<p>Programs run under Valgrind go through three phases. First, the
Valgrind core decompiles the program to a language called VEX, which
is a low-level intermediary language just above the machine code,
where many compiler details are erased. Then, the Valgrind tool can
look at this VEX, insert or remove statements, and even insert runtime
calls to tool code. Finally, Valgrind takes the modified VEX, and
compiles it back to machine code on the target architecture.</p>

<p><img src="//images/valgrind-diagram-1.png" alt="Valgrind Diagram" style="width:100%; margin:3em 0em;" /></p>

<p>Memcheck and a host of other tools (Cachegrind, Callgrind, Helgrind,
etc.) use this interface to produce complex analysis of binary
programs.</p>

<h2 id="writing-a-valgrind-tool-101">Writing a Valgrind Tool, 101</h2>

<p>A Valgrind tool sits in the middle of the Valgrind pipeline, receiving
VEX programs, operating on them, and returning them to the core. But
Valgrind doesn’t pass through the whole program at once. Instead, it
takes an approach commonly known as “just-in-time compiling”, or JIT
compiling. This involves breaking the client program up into pieces,
and compiling (or in Valgrind’s case, instrumenting) them as they are
needed.</p>

<p>Each of these pieces is what is known in compiler literature as “super
blocks”. Super blocks are pieces of code which always start in the
same place, and don’t have any internal branches or loops. They do,
however, have multiple points where they might exit, depending on some
conditions. If that’s confusing, don’t worry: for now, you can just
think of them as small pieces of code which don’t do anything tricky
like jumping around or changing what they do with an “if”
branch. Luckily, Valgrind takes care of the tricky control bits before
they reach the tool.</p>

<p>When tool code receives a piece of the client program, it’s in
Valgrind’s intermediary language VEX. VEX is kind of like the Float
Machine programs we defined in part one of the series, but it handles
a lot more of the complexity that you find in real-world machine
code. Many of these features are set up to make it more
straightforward to think about what the machine is doing on the
hardware level. The rest of this post will discuss what programs look
like at the VEX level, to set a baseline for implementing the various
“machines” that make up Herbgrind. We can understand VEX programs by
thinking about a new machine, the VEX machine.</p>

<h2 id="the-vex-machine">The VEX Machine</h2>

<p>Like programs in the Float Machine, each VEX machine superblock has an
infinite<sup id="fnref:infinite-temps" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:infinite-temps" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> set of numbered slots to store data in. All
the operations that the VEX machine does on values directly are done
on values in these slots, which are called “temporaries” in VEX
terminology. However, the temporaries only exist for as long as that
block is running. In a program made up of many blocks, you can’t use
temporaries to communicate any information between blocks.</p>

<p>Instead, you need to use one of two other types of storage, which
stick around at the end of the super block. These are called “thread
state”, and “memory”. Thread state is a small storage set which
corresponds to the registers and processor state of the underlying
computer. It’s fast to access in practice, but only has a small number
of storage slots, so values are being constantly overwritten. It’s
generally useful for short term storage between just a few
blocks. Memory, on the other hand, is extremely large and can store
objects for a long time. The downside is that’s it’s relatively slow
to use.</p>

<p>VEX programs are made up of a big list of instructions, much like the
Float Machine. One kind of VEX instruction is an operation
instruction, like the operation instruction in the float machine. It
takes arguments, which can be either constant or values from
temporaries, and runs some operation on them, storing the result in a
temporary. Since VEX has three different types of storage, there’s
another VEX instruction to move values between them. There are also
instructions which just store metadata, and some complicated things
like conditional exits which we don’t have to worry too much about for
now.</p>

<p>But it’ll probably be a lot easier to understand the role that these
instructions play if we walk through an example.</p>

<h2 id="a-simple-program-in-vex">A Simple Program in VEX</h2>

<p>Let’s look at a simple example VEX program. Let’s say you write the
program:</p>

<pre><code class="language-C">int x = 1;
int y = 2;
int z = x + 3 * y;
</code></pre>

<p>The corresponding VEX program might look a little something like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>------ IMark(0x40080D, 3, 0) ------
STle(11111111111) = 0x01:I64
------ IMark(0x400810, 7, 0) ------
STle(22222222222) = 0x02:I64
------ IMark(0x400817, 7, 0) ------
t1 = LDle:I64(22222222222)
t2 = Mul64(t1, 0x3)
------ IMark(0x40081E, 4, 0) ------
t3 = LDleI64(11111111111)
t4 = Add64(t3, t2)
STle(44444444444) = t4
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s a lot of dense text… so let’s break it down a bit.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>------ IMark(0x40080D, 3, 0) ------
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This first line is called an IMark in VEX, for Instruction
Mark. Basically, it lets you link the VEX you’re seeing back to
instructions in the binary that your tool runs on. This IMark tells
you that the VEX instructions that follow, until the next IMark, come
from the binary instruction at address 0x400080D. You don’t really
need to pay too much attention to these unless you’re debugging a
Valgrind tool. But it’s nice to know that for every VEX instruction
you deal with, you can trace it back to the binary that the user gave
you. If that binary is compiled with debug information, you can even
trace it all the way back to the source code!</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>STle(11111111111) = 0x01:I64
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This next line is storing the value \(1\) in memory at location
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">11111111111</code>. In most architectures, this address wouldn’t make any
sense, but let’s suspend our disbelief for a second here and pretend
it does; the actual memory locations don’t really matter too much. The
right hand side of the equals, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x01:I64</code>, is a numeric constant in
VEX. It has a value, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x01</code>, which is specified in hexidecimal. If it
helps, you can just replace this with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> in your head. It also has a
second part <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:I64</code>, which tells you what <em>type</em> the value has. In this
case, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">I64</code> means a 64-bit integer. There are also types <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">I32</code> for a
32-bit integer, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">F64</code> for a 64-bit float, and others<sup id="fnref:valgrind-types" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:valgrind-types" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The left side of the equality tells VEX where to put the value. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">STle</code>
means, “STore Little Endian”, where “Little Endian” is just one of the
ways that computers organize bytes.</p>

<p>Together, these two lines represent the line in the source code:</p>

<pre><code class="language-C">int x = 1;
</code></pre>

<p>Which assigns <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> to \(1\). When the program is compiled, the variable
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> gets given a concrete location in memory, in this example
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">11111111111</code>.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>------ IMark(0x400810, 7, 0) ------
STle(22222222222) = 0x02:I64
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These two lines are pretty much the same as the ones above: they store
the value \(2\) (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x02</code>) to the location <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">22222222222</code>, and correspond
to the C code:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>int y = 2;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The simply load the value two into the memory location the compiler
picked for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">22222222222</code>.</p>

<p>The next seven lines will all be part of the line:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>int z = x + 3 * y;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There’s a lot going on in this line: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code> is being muitiplied by \(3\),
then added to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code>, then stored in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">z</code>. Since VEX is much lower-level
than this source code, it uses many statements to accomplish this,
each doing one simple thing.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>------ IMark(0x400817, 7, 0) ------
t1 = LDle:I64(22222222222)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>First, an IMark, which we can ignore. The next line loads the value
we just stored into the first temporary. The command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LDle</code> means
“LoaD Little Endian”, and it grabs a value from memory. In this case,
we’re taking that value and putting it in a temporary. As I explained
above, there are an infinite number of temporaries, and they are
generally used as a “workbench” for values. In this case, we’re
loading this value (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> in the C code) up so that we can multiply it
by three.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>t2 = Mul64(t1, 0x3)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here we actually do the multiplication by three. Here, instead of a
fixed command like load or store, we have an <em>operator</em>. Each operator
in VEX has a number of arguments, in this case two, and an operator
code. There’s a big table of operator codes in the primary reference
file for Valgrind tool developers, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libvex_ir.h</code>. In this case, we
have the operator for a sixty four bit multiply, which the
pretty-printer helpfully prints for us as Mul64. In between the
parenthesis, we have the two arguments to that operator: the first one
is the temporary we loaded <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code> into in the last line, and the second
one is the constant value \(3\).</p>

<p>Once we finish with the multiply, we want to store it in another
temporary, so that’s what the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">t2 = </code> part of the line does.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>------ IMark(0x40081E, 4, 0) ------
t3 = LDleI64(11111111111)
t4 = Add64(t3, t2)
STle(44444444444) = t4
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Okay, let’s try to tackle these last four lines all at once. The first
line is another IMark, which just tells you where the instruction came
from. The second line is another load, which loads <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> into a new
temporary, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">t3</code>. The third line is another operation, this time a
64-bit add, which adds the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> we just loaded, and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y * 3</code> we
computed in the last line. Finally, in the last line, we store the
result in memory at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">44444444444</code>.</p>

<hr />

<p>That’s a VEX program, as a Valgrind tool receives it. Hopefully that
wasn’t too hard to follow. In this example, I only used integers and
integer operations, because those are often simpler. But float
operations are pretty much encoded the same way, with just different
operation codes, and types.</p>

<p>I also skipped actually showing any thread state in this example,
because I didn’t want to clutter things up with another type of
storage in the first example. Thread state works exactly like memory,
except instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LDle</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">STle</code>, we have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GET</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PUT</code>. Since it
usually represents processor state like registers, when and how it’s
used depends on how your program got compiled to binary.</p>

<p>There are many more details about Valgrind tools operate, but I don’t
want to bog you down just yet, so I’ll try to bring them up as they’re
needed.</p>

<p><a href="http://valgrind.org"><img src="http://valgrind.org/images/valgrind-link4.png" alt="Valgrind Logo" style="width:auto; display:block; margin: 0 auto" /></a></p>

<p>In the next posts, we’ll talk about how we move Herbgrind the abstract
analysis to the VEX machine and Valgrind framework, where we can run
it on real world computers. Each of the abstract machines we talked
about before will work by both transforming the VEX code as it goes
through the tool, and adding calls to it’s own code that can keep
track of the client program.</p>
<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:infinite-temps" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>Well, in theory. In practice, there is a limit, due
to some technical limitations of the Valgrind Core. We’ll
(hopefully) be discussing this later when I get into some tof the
strange obstacles I encountered during the development of
Herbgrind. For now though, we can think of the number of
temporaries as being infinite. <a href="#fnref:infinite-temps" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:valgrind-types" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>The types given by VEX to data are not exactly like
the types you’ll find in a higher level programming language. They
are only “correct” (in the sense that an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">I64</code> actually holds an
integer, and not a floating-point number), at a very local
level. While you’ll never see a float operation being run on an
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">I64</code>, VEX programs might put a value into thread state (or
memory) as an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">I64</code>, only to take it out as a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">F64</code>, sometimes
even within the same superblock. In future posts, we’ll explore
how Herbgrind layers it’s own type system on top of the one
provided by VEX to get a little more precision. But in general,
giving types to things at the machine-code level is hard <a href="#fnref:valgrind-types" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
