  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Welcome back to my series of posts on Herbgrind, a dynamic analysis
tool that finds floating point issues in compiled programs. The
purpose of this series is to explain how Herbgrind works and the
principles behind its design. To do that, we started with a simple
hypothetical computer called the “Float Machine”, which is just enough
to capture the interesting floating point behavior of a real computer,
like the one that’s probably sitting on your desk. Now, we’re bringing
Herbgrind’s analysis to the real world, making it computable and fast.</p>

<p><img src="//images/full-logo.png" alt="Herbgrind logo" style="width:30%" class="centered" /></p>

<p>If you missed the previous posts in this series, you might find this
one a bit confusing, so I suggest you go back and read it
from
<a href="//2017/04/22/introducing-herbgrind.html">the beginning</a>. If
that’s too much reading,
the
<a href="//2017/05/25/herbgrind-5-building-a-grind.html">post right before this one</a> has
a short summary of the lead up, and introduces the Valgrind framework
which this post builds on. In this post, I’m going to assume you know
what I mean when I talk about “the Real Machine”, or “thread
state”.</p>

<p>Let’s get started.</p>

<h2 id="bringing-the-real-processor-into-the-real-world">Bringing The “Real Processor” Into The Real World.</h2>

<p>Herbgrind is a tool designed to help users deal with floating-point
code, which tries to approximate the real numbers. Of course, this
wouldn’t be a problem if we could just compute with the real numbers
in the first place, but it’s not possible to actually represent the
real numbers on a computer. There’s a way to get something close
enough that it’s basically the real numbers for all intents and
purposes, called the computable reals, but they tend to be very
slow. So we’re stuck with the floating point numbers for many
applications, and the pitfalls that come with using them.</p>

<p>Hopefully, Herbgrind can help users navigate those pitfalls, by
pointing out where error is occuring, and what is causing it. But to
figure out where the answers your program is producing are
“incorrect”, we need to know what the “correct” answer is. And to do
<strong>that</strong>, we need to compute with the real numbers. See the problem
here?</p>

<p>In the abstract version of Herbgrind, given in parts 1-4 of this
series, we didn’t worry about how we’d compute the real number answer,
because we were working in the abstract. But now that we’re trying to
bring Herbgrind to a real computer, we need to figure it out.</p>

<p>The solution comes from a great library
called <a href="http://www.mpfr.org/">GNU MPFR</a>, or sometimes just MPFR for
short. MPFR stands for Multi-Precision Floating-point Reliably,
because it allows you to do floating point calculations with any
number of bits, instead of just 64- or 32-bit floats<sup id="fnref:mpfr-name" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:mpfr-name" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.mpfr.org/mpfr500.png" alt="MPFR logo" /></p>

<p>MPFR numbers still aren’t real numbers, since they still only have a
limited number of bits. But adding more bits to your representation
generally means you get closer to the real
numbers<sup id="fnref:limited-precision" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:limited-precision" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. So, if your 64-bit answer and your
1000-bit answer disagree, your 64-bit answer is definitely not the
same as the real number answer. Another way to think of this is that
if you measure the error of the 64-bit answer with respect to the
1000-bit answer, you’ll get a lower bound on the error of your 64-bit
answer with respect to the real numbers.</p>

<p>You might be thinking, “if MPFR numbers are so great, why not just use
them for all of our floating-point math and be done with it?”. And for
some applications, that’s a great solution. Unfortunately, operations
on MPFR numbers can be hundreds to thousands of times slower than
their hardware floating-point counterparts. So for many of the
applications which we use floating-point for, they are just too
slow. In Herbgrind, however, we’re okay with being slower than a
regular program, because we’re only trying to find the floating point
errors, not monitor the program every time you run it.</p>

<p>With MPFR in our toolbox, we can implement the “Real processor”
outlined in the earlier post about the Real Machine. But there’s still
another part to the Real Machine, “Real memory”, which is trickier
than it at first appears.</p>

<h2 id="memory-for-reals">Memory For Reals</h2>

<p>In the idealized Float Machine, floating-point memory was just a big
list of numbers. Every operation in the program referred to locations
in this list to take it’s arguments from, and a location to put the
result in. When we added the idealized Real Machine into the mix, it
had a parallel list of real numbers, and “mirrored” all of the
operations on those. Now that we’re working on the VEX machine though,
things get more complicated.</p>

<h4 id="mixed-type-memory">Mixed-Type Memory</h4>
<p>In the Float Machine there were two memory banks, one for integers,
and one for floating-point numbers. In the VEX machine there is no
such distinciton: any location could hold either<sup id="fnref:VEX-types" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:VEX-types" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. The
simplest solution to this issue is to treat every location in memory
as a float, given a shadow value at the beginning of the
program. Unfortunately, this would mean creating a shadow value for
every location in memory, thread state, and temporaries, which would
take far too much space!</p>

<p>Instead, we’ll take a lazy approach. At the beginning of the program,
we’ll assume each value is a non-float. Then, whenever we run a
floating point operation, we’ll mark both of it’s inputs as floats,
give them shadow values based on their current value, and execute the
operation producing a shadow result. This lazy approach is pretty
efficient, only storing the shadows that we might need.</p>

<p><img src="//images/shadow-storage-1.png" alt="Shadow storage diagram" /></p>

<p>This approach leaves a lot of program statments untracked. Before its
first floating point operation, a value might be moved around, packed
into data structures and unpacked, and have its bits flipped for
various reasons. But none of these statements can introduce floating
point error, since they don’t correspond to any real number
operation. Even if a value came from some other part of the program
and had arbitrary transformations done on them, we wouldn’t know how
to interpret those operations as real number transformations. The
first time we have any possible error to track is exactly when we make
the shadow value for the first time: at the first floating point
operation.</p>

<p>It has one subtlety though, and that comes with how it interacts with
the many ways of representing floats. You see, the VEX machine doesn’t
have a single type of floating-point number, it has two; just like an
x86 processor, or any other modern processor for that matter, VEX
includes both 32- and 64-bit floats[^no-80-bit]. It also happens to
represent values which are packed into an array of up to 256 bits. VEX
of course contains instructions for converting between these formats,
like turning a 32-bit float into a 64-bit one, or pulling a 32-bit
float out of the first quarter of a 128-bit array. So what do we do
when these kinds of operations are run on something that we have not
yet determined is a float?</p>

<p>[^no-80-bit] 32-bit processors using x87 also include 80-bit floats,
    bur they can cause a myriad of problems. Herbgrind has been developed
    for 64-bit processors, and only really supports SSE and it’s
    sucessors, which became the standard in the early 2000’s (first
    released in 1999). As a result, we don’t really deal with 80-bit
    floats.</p>

<p>Well, it’d be safe to treat them like a floating point operation, and
add a shadow value to them. But we don’t really <em>have</em> to do that, do
we? Since these operations can’t have any error, it’s totally safe to
ignore them if they’re run on bytes that aren’t shadowed yet. But if
the bytes <strong>are</strong> already shadowed, we’ll need to do the proper
transformation on the shadow; just transforming the bytes means we
might lose information about the exact value. So for these
conversions, we’ll treat them like floating-point operations if they
are running on something we already know is a floating-point number,
and we’ll treat them like integer operations otherwise.</p>

<h4 id="expensive-shadows">Expensive Shadows</h4>
<p>Even when we’re only shadowing values which are actually floats,
shadow values can be really memory intensive! For each 32- or 64-bit
float, just the real number shadow takes upwards of a thousand bits,
not to mention the extra information we’ll be tacking on later!</p>

<p>Luckily, we can exploit some redundancy in the program to get that
cost down. You see, most of the floating point values you’ll find in a
program’s memory aren’t unique. Lots of them are just copies of one
another, created because multiple parts of the program need to use the
same value, or simply a by-product of copying the value to move it
around, and not deleting the old copy. Since values are often
identical, we don’t always need to shadow them with separate shadow
values. Instead, we can use the same shadow value for every copy of
the same value.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, just because two values have the same literal bytes
doesn’t mean we can treat them like copies; they could have different
exact values, but just be rounded to the same thing. But when we see a
copy instruction, instead of creating another shadow value for the
copy, we can just add a new reference to the old shadow.</p>

<p><img src="//images/shadow-storage-2.png" alt="Shadow storage diagram" /></p>

<p>In many programming languages, when we create multiple references to
the same object, the language will automatically manage the memory for
that object, and figure out how to free the object when the references
are gone. But when we’re writing our analysis inside valgrind, we’re
working outside the structures of these high level
languages. Herbgrind (like most Valgrind tools) is written in C, which
is low-level as it is, but the code which runs at runtime (after the
program has been instrumented) is even lower-level in a sense, and
extremely performance sensitive. So we won’t get anyone helping us
with managing the memory of our shared shadow values, we have to do it
ourselves.</p>

<p>The simplest approach to memory management is just to make copies of
everything, and share nothing. This way, every piece of the code knows
it’s the only one handling its data, and can free it when it’s
done. But we already know that’s too expensive for the shadow values
in Herbgrind.</p>

<p>The easiest version of memory management from a user perspective is
called garbage collection. This means we keep track of all of our most
basic references in some sort of table, and then every once in a while
stop the program, trace the references to figure out which objects can
be freed, and free them. This is the approach that many modern
high-level languages, like Java, Python, Lisp, or OCaml,
use. Unfortunately this is too time-consuming for Herbgrind, since it
means stopping the program and doing complex analysis, in an
environment where every instruction counts.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the middle is an approach called reference counting. In
reference counting, each object that you want to share has a counter,
called a reference count. When it’s first created, and only one piece
of code has access to it, it’s reference count is one. Whenever a new
piece of code or data gets a reference to that object, we increase
it’s reference count. When code or data is done with the reference,
and deletes it, it does two things. First, it decreases the reference
count. Then, if the reference count is zero, it frees the object.</p>

<p>There are two downsides to this approach. First, it doesn’t deal well
with cyclic data structures. If object A has a reference to object B,
and object B has a reference to object C, and object C has a reference
to object A, they might never be freed! Of course, if someone else has
a reference to one of these objects, they shouldn’t be freed, but even
when everyone else has divested themselves, each object still has one
reference to it. To make sure this doesn’t happen, code using
reference counting has to be very careful about what kinds of data
structures it creates[^herbgrind-cycles].</p>

<p>[^herbgrind-cycles] For the real number shadows, Herbgrind doesn’t
    generally have to worry about cycles. But once we start dealing with
    symbolic expression trees, it’s pretty common to have objects which
    reference each other.</p>

<p><img src="//images/cycle.png" alt="Reference cycle diagram" /></p>

<p>Which brings us to the second downside of reference counting, that
it’s heavily error-prone. With no language support, it’s easy to make
a mistake, and either count too many references (never freeing the
object), or too few (freeing it too early, and potentially trying to
use it after).</p>

<p>Reference counting has a big upside in performance though, because it
allows us to share objects, with basically no extra runtime
computation. In Herbgrind’s case, this makes it the right tradeoff, so
it’s what we use.</p>

<h4 id="multiple-types-of-storage">Multiple Types of Storage</h4>
<p>In addition to storage in the VEX machine holding both integers and
floating point numbers, and the workarounds needed to keep memory
usage down, we also have to deal with the fact that there are now
three types of storage where floating point numbers can exist, not
just one. With that comes new program statements for moving values
around between storage types, as well as some subtleties of the types
themselves.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the temporaries, since in many respects they are the
simplest. Temporaries in VEX are an infinite list of storage
locations, where each location can hold a float, a double, or a few
floats or doubles put together. Processors like the x86 family often
have instructions that can manipulate several floating point numbers
at once. Instead of just taking two floating point numbers and adding
them, they can take two blocks containing two double-precision numbers
each, and multiply them in parallel. In VEX, this translates into a
special mulitply instruction on two temporaries, each of which holds
two double-precision values.</p>

<p>These multiple-value temporaries present the first challenge with
shadowing temporaries. While we normally only need one shadow value
per storage location, in the case of a temporary that holds multiple
floating point values, we’ll need multiple shadow values. To handle
this, Herbgrind includes a notion of <em>shadow temporary</em>. A shadow
temporary is a structure that holds one or more shadow values. It’s
not always clear from the size of a temporary how many values are in
it: a 128-bit temporary could hold two doubles, or four singles. So we
give each shadow temporary a runtime type (as well as a static type,
when possible), which indicates how many values it’s shadowing, so
there’s no confusion.</p>

<p>We’re going to need some way to keep track of what shadow temporaries
coorespond to what temporaries in our VEX program. Each temporary in
VEX has a number that represents it, and that the program uses to
refer to it (t1, t2, t3, etc). So to keep track of their shadows,
we’ll create a similarly numbered list of shadow temporaries. Since
we’re not going to shadow all the temporaries, some of these slots are
empty (a NULL pointer instead of a pointer to a shadow temporary). But
we still have a problem: there are (in theory) an infinite set of
temporaries! We can’t hold on to an infinite set of pointers, even if
most of them are NULL. So when we first look at each code block to
start instrumenting it, we’ll figure out how many temporaries are
actually used in practice, and only create a list that big. Just to be
safe, we’ll also add a global limit to how many temporaries we’re
willing to shadow, so things don’t get too crazy.</p>

<p>After the temporaries are shadowed, the next type of VEX storage that
we’ll have to shadow is thread state. Thread state represents the
registers and cpu flags of the underlying program. But at the VEX
level, it doesn’t look like a bunch of named registers, it looks like
an array of bytes. For any register on the processor, there’s a
location in this array that cooresponds to it. But instead of this
byte array having slots for each value, it’s completely unstructured;
it’s just bytes. A single floating-point value can take up four or
eight bytes, and you can’t usually count on things being aligned in a
nice way.</p>

<p>To handle this, we’ll pretend that each floating-point value can take
up a single byte. Then, we’ll shadow the bytes much like we shadowed
temporaries, with a parallel list where each shadow aligns with the
thing it’s shadowing in the original list. But when we store a
floating point value in a location in thread state, we’ll store it’s
shadow in the first byte of that location in the shadow thread state,
and then mark some of the bytes after as “non-float”. For instance, if
we’re storing a 64-bit float in thread state at byte 240, we’ll store
it’s shadow in shadow thread state at byte 240, and then set bytes
241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, and 247 to “non-float”.</p>

<p>The last type of storage is memory. Memory is a list of bytes like
thread state, so we’ll use the same trick we just described to shadow
it. But unlike thread state, memory is huge. And unlike the
temporaries, we’re not always storing values right at the beginning of
memory (in fact, we rarely are), so we can’t just pick a reasonable
prefix of memory to shadow. Instead, values can be stored all around,
sometimes seperated from each other by gigabytes of “dead” space.</p>

<p>So instead of using a big array to store our values, we use a hash
table. For those who aren’t familiar, a hash table is a mapping from
keys to values, with constant lookup time, and using much less storage
than the number of possible keys. In the case of shadow memory, our
keys are memory addresses, and our values are shadow values. With the
magic of hash functions, we can allow storing shadow values at any
memory address, without having to use as much space as all of memory
when we’re <strong>not</strong> storing things in all of memory.</p>

<hr />

<p>Now that we’ve figured out how to shadow all these types of memory,
the rest is reasonably straightforward (well, until you try to
actually implement it…). When we see an instruction in the original
program which moves a value from memory to thread state, for instance,
or from a temporary to memory, we will add an instruction which moves
from the shadow temporary which cooresponds to the source location, to
the shadow destination. When we see a floating point instruction in
the original program which is doing some sort of mathematical
operation, we’ll create shadow values for the arguments if they don’t
exist, and put the shadow result in the shadow destination. With just
these two parts (a way to create and manipulate shadow values, and a
way to move them around), we can track the entire execution of the
program. When it’s finally done, wherever it puts the result, we’ll
find an exact result in the cooresponding shadow temporary.</p>

<p>That’s pretty much it for the Real Machine! With these parts, we can
get the (almost) exactly correct result, and we can compare it to the
computed result to figure out how much error there is.</p>
